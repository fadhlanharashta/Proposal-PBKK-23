## Proposal

For our final project, we plan to make a promotional marketing website.
The website will show all the product that we sell.
Each product will have a unique id and other component (name, price, caption, availability) so user can learn more about the product before deciding to purchase the product.

<br>

The website will be made using Laravel and MySQL will be used for making the database.

<br>
